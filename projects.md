## HabCal (VandyHacks)
### Short Note:
Created a web application using react where you get introduced to your virtual pet (cat).
The cat gets happy or sad depending on the activities and tasks you complete during the day.
### Long Note:
HabCal is a kid friendly web application that triggers people to get good habits. The application comes with three tabs or navigation. The first tab where your virtual cat lives is basically a GIF image of a cartoon cat that is neutral in expression. The second tab is the task tab. When you log-in to the app using google OAuth2, your Google Calender data is sent to the app. The concept is simple, if you do the task of the day you click yes else click no. Depending on if you finish your task and answered yes, the expression of the cat changes. The more tasks you finish the happier the cat gets and the more tasks you leave behind the sadder the cat gets. The cat is reset everyday after 24 hours is complete. The idea here is to keep the virtual pet happy by improving your habits.

## StockAlert(VolHacks)
### Short Note:
Developed and deployed a notification app that sends text notification to your phone when the price of a certain stock falls under the condition you provide.
### Long Note:
StockAlert is a simple notification application developed for desktop platform. The application has one simple purpose. It lets you put the stock symbols (Eg. TSLA for Tesla) on the search bar. When the search form is submitted, the application uses Alphadvantage API to query the stock symbols and get the stock prices per minute which is displayed on the screen. The user has option to put both low and hight price on the side of the stock name. The messaging API used for this project was Twilio API which allowed us to test with around 100 messages. The authentication part was not completed for the project and hence could only be used for testing for particular individual whose cell number was hard-coded on the main.js file.
### Technologies Used:
Electron.js, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Git & Github, VS-Code, Twilio API, Alphaadvantage API

## DrumRoll (Fun Project)
### Short Note:
Designed a fun front-end website that mimics drum sounds. Basically, it listens to the key strokes and depending on particular stroke, it creates particular drum sound. This was my side project to learn Vanilla JS and CSS3.
###  Long Note:
While creating a fun web front-end application DrumRoll, I had opportunity to learn more about CSS3 (specially CSS Grid) and Vanilla  Javascript. The project is coded using plain HTML with Javascript listening to keystrokes and playing a certain audio file depending on which key stroke was in action. I had fun developing this website. It is basic but fun to use.
### Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Vs-Code, Git & Github

## C++ Intermediate (Class Project)
### Short Note:
Worked on C++ programming for a semester. Learned the basics of the C++ programming and worked on six class projects.
### Long Note:
C++ is a very fun programming language that started the trend of Object Orient Programming. When I came to realize that  Java was written in C++, I had to take this class to get the taste of C++. I did several coding challenges and also completed many projects for the class. All of those codes can be found on my github repository. In addition to this, I also performed a programming test for a company callled Think-Cell, where I had to take the <map.h> library function and modify it in order to take mapping of bounds i.e. (min, max) mapped to some data. The coding was a challenge and took me around 7 hours to finish.
### Technologies Used:
C++, Vs-Code, Git & Github

## GoLang
### Short Note:
Created and tested some Go Programming. Not the expert in this language but have basic knowledge. It is interesting to know that every PHP for different html pages needs to be different. GoLang makes it simple to create a central back-end hub for the server-side programming.
## Long Note:
GoLang is very unique programming language for back-end development. This programming language came across my studies during my PHP classes. The project I did in PHP was supposed to be re-written in Go Language and I was shocked by how it saved me tons of lines. The architectural design of the programming language is very different than other back-end languages. I believe I performed two projects for writing server-side code for my version 1 code that was written in PHP 7.
### Technologies Used:
GoLang, MySql, Vs-Code, Git & Github

## CodeScene Analysis
### Short Note:
Analyzed and evaluated on going projects for the sign of Complexities i.e. Technical Depth and refactor accordingly. Helped me to learn how to optimize existing code and also to perform proper refactoring methods in order to make the complexity trend as low as possible for future coders in the project.
### Long Note:
CodeScene is software application that lets us run Technical Analysis on existing programming code and helps us to visually look at the code architecture and its defects. These defects are called "Hotspot" which inform about how often the code has been modified and how large the files are. Taking these factors into account, we have to come up with a refactoring the code so that they are easy to comprehend to the new programmers who might join the team later. I personally worked on three projects for Code Refactoring. The projects that I worked on were: Docker Container, OTP and Aesprite.
### Technologies Used:
CodeScence, Vs-Code, Git & Github

## Linux System Programming
### Short Note:
Learned intermediate and complex Unix Programming using Linux Terminal. Familiarized myself with the Linux system and its use as a System Manager.
### Long Note:
Linux is very powerful and poplar Open-Source Operating System. I love this operating system as it comes in various flavors depending on what your needs are. My favorite environment to work on is Linux Mint and Ubuntu. For this class I particularly used Ubuntu. The things that I came across this semester were very impressive. I got hands on experience to run whole system with just a terminal. I got to create files that can create new users for system, create rights for those users, create and test deployed networks. Allocate space and hardware power to users depending on the needs. Basically, it was a learning curve to become a System Manager.
### Technologies Used:
Ubuntu, Terminal, Vim-Editor, Turing, WinSpc, PuTTY

## Networking Protocols
### Short Note:
Coded custom File Transfer Protocol and User DataGram Protocol using Java Programming Language. Deployed and tested the Protocols by transferring files from client side folder to the server side folder by creating a authenticating cmd UI.
### Long Note:
The purpose of this project is to create a custom File Transfer Protocol and a User DataGram Protocol that can performs user authentication and then allow those users to transfer files from the server or to upload file to the server. I built a simple Command Line UI for the users to navigate the protocols. First when the program runs, the users need to provide their credentials. If true, the user gets access to the file system present on the server. The user can then navigate through the filesystem similar to that of a UNIX system. The program displays all the folders and files present in the system. A programmer can navigate to a folder by typing its name and go back to parent directory by typing "back". In order for the user to download the file in the server, they simply need to put in the file name and the file gets delivered to the the user folder. The concept for uploading the files is same as well. The user navigates through the user folder and then when types the name of file to be uploaded, it gets uploaded to the server folder.
### Technologies Used:
Ecplise, Java, Git & Github

## Delivrd
### Short Note:
Mimicked UberEats and LandShark to create a web-application for food runners. Helped me to build up the importance of team collaboration and created an atmosphere to dive into the world of react.js and express.js.
### Long Note:
Delivrd is a web application that was created with a team of 5 members including me. This web application is similar to that of UberEats or GrubHub. The application consist of three major users: The Customer, the Driver and the Restaurant Owner. The UI for each users are created different with some abstract classes between them. The web application takes data from a MongoDB and has access to lots of features. Users can navigate to menus, search restaurant by type and other additional features. My part was to work on front-end using react with jsx files. This was the first time I was introduced to react and its powerful features. I worked to create the Customer frontend and then went to work on backend with express.js. I would say I was 90% front-end and 10% back-end developer for this project and gained basic knowledge on MongoDB when we finished this project. The team collaboration was a great opportunity for me. I got to work with some of the finest students in the university. We had some issues while working at the beginning of the project due to time management, but we quickly caught on and then completed the project before its deadline.
### Technologies Used:
React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Vs-Code, Git & Github, POSTMan (Backend Testing)

## Pizza-Mania
### Short Note:
Created a decentralized web-application that creates a rewards system for pizza lovers. The transactions are handled on Ethereum  and the backend is written on smart contract using Solidity programming language.
### Long Note:
Pizza-Mania was one of the newest projects I have worked on. This application is written on Blockchain, hence, fully decentralized and thus does not run on any back-end server. The front-end was designed on bootstrap and vs-code at the beginning which I switched to React later on. The back-end code is written in Ethereum smart contract using Solidity programming language and Remix online editor. The connection between the front-end react and the back-end smart contract is done using web3.js which is a very popular library for Ethereum blockchain. The contract can be deployed and used on any test network. The key concept behind this application is to make transaction using ETH and get rewards every time users buy pizza from any pizza place. The task is simple, buy  a pizza and get points for each pizza. When the total points is 10, you can order a pizza for free. But unlike traditional pizza rewards brand, this one is not subjected to any particular pizza company. You can buy pizza from any of the partners pizza companies and then earn rewards for a free one. This was my first step to decentralized application.

## Database Management
### Short Note:
Worked on several projects in  database management class for learning PHP and MySQL. The class was highly focused on developing and improving our skills on database management. 
### Long Note:
Database Management was one of my courses that I enjoyed the most. Thought we did work with Firebase and GoLang a little bit, the class was fully focused on developing our skills regarding MySQL. The backend language taken for these projects was PHP. The main aspect of these projects were to teach us the use of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for MySQL database. The front-end for most of the project was provided by the professor. The back-end had to be fully developed by us. The final project we worked on was a full-stack website that had ability to perform all intermediate actions between front-end and the database.
### Technologies Used:
PHP, MySQL, WAMP, Notepad++, Git & Github

## Custom Cipher Algorithm
### Short Note:
Created a custom cipher algorithm using Python. Tested with accurate cipher and decipher of a texts. Want to deploy it in my own personal projects later.
### Long Note:
During my class for CryptoCurrency, I came across many kind of Cipher algorithms and the most basic of them all i.e. Caesar Cipher interested me a lot. Therefore, I went on to create my own Cipher algorithm. This algorithm is nothing special but just my admiration to the first developer. The algorithm uses similar technique but with more complex pattern. The detail on the cipher code can be found on my github page. This was a fun project for me cause it really helped me to build interest towards Cryptography and its potentials.
### Technologies Used:
Python, Vs-Code, Git & Github

## Internet Dealers
### Short Note:
Deployed a functional website called "Internet Dealers" for Web Development Class. Created using regular web-development tools like bootstrap and vanilla javascript.
### Long Note:
Internet Dealers is a topic that I came up with to develop my website for the web development class. The website is the concept of providing online call dealership which is fictional. The website provides similar features as any other car dealership website like CarMax.com, Cars.com, etc but unlike those website, this one is only focused to provide online car purchase. The website is front-end friendly i.e. the backend for the website has not been created as the purpose of the class was only to sharp our skill on front-end part and some of Firebase Authentication and Database. We did implement the feature of Firebase Login and  GoogleOAuth2 with data retrieve from Firebase database. The skills that I acquired from this class were very important for me to get grasp on front-end design and programming. I will be continuing to develop this website to sharpen my skills further.
### Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, Firebase/ FireStore, Bootstrap, Vs-Code, Git & Github

## UltimateBattleground
### Short Note:
Came up with an idea to create  a GameHub where Gamers can play games and then earn rewards for their victory. The website is still underdevelopment but can be accessed at www.ulimatebattleground.com
### Long Answer:
UltimateBattleground is an ongoing project of mine. This website is the first step that I am taking towards actual web development for consumer face. The website is simple. It is a game hub for players who play a game called PUBG (Player Unknown Battle Ground). The website allows users to login and spend ticket on lucky draw for a game. If chosen to play the game and if the player wins the game, the person is rewarded from us. The website has no use right now as it is still developing. The reason I stopped developing the website is because I wanted to switch to react.js and use mongodb for the database. Currently, the website runs on html, js, php and mysql which is also not responsive in nature. I wish to finish this project by the end of my final semester before my graduation.

## Maze Runner-Neural Network
### Short Note:
Trained a neural network to identify and figure out if a maze has an exit or not. Tested with all possible data from a 5x5 block maze where 0 represents a path and 1 represents a block. Trained data with amount of (2^25) possibilities using University Super-Computer, the network could identify 97.3% of provided tests.
### Long Answer:
Working with neural network is one of my biggest and most fun project. When I dived in the area of Data Science, I was amazed of how data has been the new asset in 2019. I got the taste of this massive data when I had to design and test a neural network. The project was to create a neural network that could identify if a provided 5x5 matrix with 0's and 1's where 0 is a path and 1 is a block, is a maze or not. This meant that the maze should have opening at the top-left and should come out from the bottom-right. Unlike taking some sample data and training the network with long cycles, I created an algorithm that would give me all possible bits from 25 0's to 25 1's with the answer if they were maze or not. I trained my neural network using University Supercomputer as they provided me with extra computing power. It took me around 3 days to fully train my neural network using 2^25 data-sets and 1000 cycles. Eventually, when testing, the network could fully identify 97.3% of the total test case provided to it.

## Motion Recognition
### Short Note:
Worked on python project to detect frequent motions on the image frames of provided video footage. Tested the project on a video frames of University cafeteria to see the results.
### Long Note:
Motion Recognition is a small yet very interesting project I worked on during my Sophomore year. I was given a research opportunity to detect camera motions in order to analyze sudden moments on a steady area. For, this project, I had to come with a program that could taken in dynamic images as input which will be image frames taken from a video and output an image that marks the area mostly affect by motion. For this, I used python to get each RGB value of pixel in the images and calculate standard deviation from it. If the SD value of each pixel is greater than the threshold value, it was replaced by a red pixel. This is how the motions were tracked in a final sample output image.

## Tv-Series Sentiment
### Short Note:
Created a program to perform sentimental analysis on a dialogue script of Tv-Series. Tested and correctly analyzed the test scripts using the sentiment lexicon data provided for the project.
### Long Note:
Tv-Series Sentiment is one of the fascinating project I have worked on. For this project, we had to read through numerous dialogues script of a Tv-Series and decide if the each episode will create a positive, negative or neutral attitude towards the viewers. For the purpose of this project I was given a sentiment lexicon file. This file had words with their lexicon value ranging from -1 to +1. The word from -1.0 to -0.1 were considered negative where as from +0.1 to +1.0 were considered positive and 0.0 as neutral value. The program mostly dealt with creating and filtering the text of each episode dialogues. The words acquired was crossed checked with the words from sentiment lexicon to receive the lexicon value. These values were then plotted in a bar graph under X-axis with indices [Negative, W. Negative, Neutral, W. Positive and Positive]. This was done to give a visual presentation of the data.
