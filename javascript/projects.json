It is a game hub for players who play a game called PUBG (Player Unknown Battle Ground). The website allows users to login and spend ticket on lucky draw for a game. If chosen to play the game and if the player wins the game, the person is rewarded from us. The website has no use right now as it is still developing. The reason I stopped developing the website is because I wanted to switch to react.js and use mongodb for the database. Currently, the website runs on html, js, php and mysql which is also not responsive in nature. I wish to finish this project by the end of my final semester before my graduation.",

        "description":"Working with neural network is one of my biggest and most fun project. When I dived in the area of Data Science, I was amazed of how data has been the new asset in 2019. I got the taste of this massive data when I had to design and test a neural network. The project was to create a neural network that could identify if a provided 5x5 matrix with 0's and 1's where 0 is a path and 1 is a block, is a maze or not. This meant that the maze should have opening at the top-left and should come out from the bottom-right. Unlike taking some sample data and training the network with long cycles, I created an algorithm that would give me all possible bits from 25 0's to 25 1's with the answer if they were maze or not. I trained my neural network using University Supercomputer as they provided me with extra computing power. It took me around 3 days to fully train my neural network using 2^25 data-sets and 1000 cycles. Eventually, when testing, the network could fully identify 97.3% of the total test case provided to it.",

If true, the user gets access to the file system present on the server. The user can then navigate through the filesystem similar to that of a UNIX system. The program displays all the folders and files present in the system. A programmer can navigate to a folder by typing its name and go back to parent directory by typing 'back'. In order for the user to download the file in the server, they simply need to put in the file name and the file gets delivered to the the user folder. The concept for uploading the files is same as well. The user navigates through the user folder and then when types the name of file to be uploaded, it gets uploaded to the server folder.",

The connection between the front-end react and the back-end smart contract is done using web3.js which is a very popular library for Ethereum blockchain. The contract can be deployed and used on any test network. The key concept behind this application is to make transaction using ETH and get rewards every time users buy pizza from any pizza place. The task is simple, buy  a pizza and get points for each pizza. When the total points is 10, you can order a pizza for free. But unlike traditional pizza rewards brand, this one is not subjected to any particular pizza company. You can buy pizza from any of the partners pizza companies and then earn rewards for a free one. This was my first step to decentralized application.",

If the SD value of each pixel is greater than the threshold value, it was replaced by a red pixel. This is how the motions were tracked in a final sample output image.",

The word from -1.0 to -0.1 were considered negative where as from +0.1 to +1.0 were considered positive and 0.0 as neutral value. The program mostly dealt with creating and filtering the text of each episode dialogues. The words acquired was crossed checked with the words from sentiment lexicon to receive the lexicon value.
